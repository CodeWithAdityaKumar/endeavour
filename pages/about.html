            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="contents">
            <p>Endeavour is a robotics team based in SLIET, Punjab. It has had its presence in the national robotics
                scene for the past half a decade, over years the team has worked on projects such as E-yantra (Bombay),
                TEQIP (GOI &amp; World bank), SAE Aero Design Challenge, and other projects for social welfare, the team
                has also participated in several prestigious events held at premier institutions in our country, the
                team has participated at Techfest (IIT Bombay), ABU ROBOCON, Indian drone racing league (IIT Delhi &amp;
                VIT Vellore), APOGEE (BITS Pilani), Technex (IIT BHU), Techkriti (IIT Kanpur) and Advitya (IIT Ropar) to
                name a few. The team has brought many laurels to the college proving its excellence. The team provides a
                platform where one can bridge the gap between theoretical and practical knowledge. When the world
                stalled, we were still able to make progress with our continued efforts and hard work. We strive to
                create a difference.</p>

        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
        <p>The team was initially started to reinforce the technical prospect of students, enabling them to become
            refined concocts having knowledge of diverse fields. Following the current trends, everyone is in hunt to
            become that polymath, who is capable of handling any work assigned. So for this, what will be better than
            working in the field of robotics. A field that needs no introduction where people from varied backgrounds
            come and work in harmony, contribute their part and learn in reciprocation. Robotics is the collective
            implementation of latest technologies &amp; using it for our ease that certainly requires profound technical
            expertise. According to a survey conducted by a reputed firm, around 80% of engineers are not employable for
            the industry. These statistics don't need any explanation as such, so our initiative is just a contribution
            to bring a change &amp; enhance the technical calibre of engineering graduates.</p><a name="ourHistory"

    <div class="mission">
        <h2>OUR VISION</h2>
        <p>The team was founded with the intentions to encourage engineering undergraduates to be able to understand
            different technology stacks used in robotics, outside their regular curriculum. Now, the team participates
            in competitions both at college as well as national levels. The main motive is to make students aware of the
            upcoming technologies not just by mugging up the theories but also by practically implementing the theories
            they've learnt. The outstanding achievements of the team in the last few years has attracted a great amount
            of eligible students to its door, thereby helping the team excel in every field,either be learning or
            managing and holding the team together. Hence, with ambitious goals and a well built team, the team has
            decided to take part in international events too.</p><a name="ourHistory" id="ourHistory"
